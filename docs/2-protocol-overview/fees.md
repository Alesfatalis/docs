| Network Fee           | Paid to Miners or Node stake pools | Native network currency (ERG/ADA) | min - âˆž (user choice)                 |
| Protocol Fee (LP fee) | Fee charged by each specific pool   | Output asset of the operation     | 0-100% (set when the pool is created) |
| Execution Fee         | Paid to execution bots             | Native network currency (ERG/ADA) | [Formula](#execution-fee-formula)     |
| UI Fee                | Paid to UI provider                | Native network currency (ERG/ADA) | 0.01 ERG / 0.4 ADA                    |

:::caution
The total fee for ony operation varies from $0.5 to $5, depending on the rational choice of Nitro (read more
below). The best way to get lower fees is to leave default Nitro value. Change Nitro only if you completely 
understand what is going on!
:::

#### Execution fee formula

**Execution Fee** is always a range of values (`minExFee - maxExFee`)

`minExFee = minerFee * 1.5`

`1.5`: constant factor which have to satisfy the condition `minExFee > minerFee`

`maxExFee = minExFee * Nitro`

#### What is Nitro?
**Nitro** is the multiplier of the max execution fee. It is defined in order to give the user the ability to control 
both the speed order execution and the maximum possible output.

`MaxOutput = maxExFee / exFeePerToken`

where

`exFeePerToken = minExFee / minOutput`
