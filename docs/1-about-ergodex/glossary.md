## Automated Market Maker
An automated market maker (AMM) is a smart contract that holds liquidity reserves. Users can trade against these 
reserves at prices determined by a fixed formula. Anyone may contribute liquidity to these smart contracts, earning trading fees in return.

## Orderbook

## Asset

## Redeem
An act of reclaiming liquidity which was provided to a liquidity pool earlier plus protocol fees. 

## Refund
Used to refund a submitted transaction that has failed or stuck due to low liquidity/low slippage value used.

## Constant Product Formula
The automated market-making algorithm used by ErgoDEX, `x*y=c`. where `x` and `y` are deposits on tokens X and Y respectively and c is their product which has to remain constant after swap operations. CFMMs provide liquidity across the entire price range.
