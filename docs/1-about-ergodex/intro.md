# Introduction

## What is ErgoDEX?
ErgoDEX is a non-custodial decentralized exchange that allows a quick, effortless, and secure 
transfer of liquidity inside and between the Ergo and Cardano networks. The eUTXO model gives the unique possibility to have shared 
liquidity among different networks. ErgoDEX will eventually feature a full AMM, Order Book and more.

consequence exists for purposes of both communities. You can imagine ErgoDEX infrastructure like the following:

  products;

- **ErgoDEX User Interface (UI):** Web (or mobile) interface which provides access in conjunction with the protocol;
- **ErgoDEX Execution Bots:** off-chain software which function is to execute DEX orders and which works in completely
