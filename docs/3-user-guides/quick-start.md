- [Yoroi Nightly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yoroi-nightly/poonlenmfdfbjfeeballhiibknlknepo): the wallet app;

:::caution Warning
Note that Yoroi Nightly and Yoroi dApp connector are not a stable version or Yoroi wallet. We are currently working with
Emurgo (Yoroi wallet developer) on an updated version of Yoroi.
