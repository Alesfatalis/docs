### TVL

TVL stands for Total Value Locked. This is an addition of all the funds locked in either the complete DEX, which can be seen up the top left of the homepage, or also in each pool.
A higher TVL value is always going to be better. It will mean swaps have less chance of failing due to slippage tolerance as there is much more liquidity in the pool, meaning less volatility.

### Volume 24H:

Volume is a cumulative $value for all trades completed on the DEX over the span of 24 hours. It is shown as both the overall DEX volume, but you can also check specifically for each pool.

### Fee Tier

This is the fee charged by each pool to make a transaction. It is set when the pool is created, these fee profits are paid in the asset received in the output of the transaction. 
These fees are what contribute to the liquidity pool to ensure liquidity providers are rewarded.


### Yearly Fees

This is a dynamic % value that will let someone calculate their liquidity pool gains. This will change according to volume of swaps in the pool.
